Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was a prototype thermostat. It board needed to read the ambient room temperature, turn on the heater based on the ambient room temperature compared to the setpoint, 
indicate whether the heater was on with an onboard LED, and display the system information to the screen.

What did you do particularly well?

I needed to use a timer and a task scheduler to rotate through the different tasks of the program. I am proud that I was able to figure it out following the instructions and reading materials.

Where could you improve?

The states and transitions used were a bit cluttered. I know I could have consolidated it down because there were redundant results.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The board is capable of transmitting through WiFi. I would rerouted the UART to transmite the system information wirelessly instead of displaying it to a screen.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

There were a lot. Understanding timers, bit manipulation, memory conservation, function use, etc. These were things I had a general understanding of, so it was good to go deeper into the concepts 
and actually work with them.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Functions, comments, and diagrams.
